# ThermoControl_DDorch

This code is a C code made for fonctionning with Arduino Uno Hardware.

The aim of this project is to regulate an indoor temperature using ventilation with outdoor temperature. The program control if the temperature is favourable and run the fan consequently.

The hardware is mainly composed of:
- 1 Arduino Uno
- 1 Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller
- 2 LM35 temperature sensors
- 3 press buttons
- 1 BC547 transistor
- 1 led
- 1 10 kΩ variable resistor
- 2 1 kΩ resistor
- 1 220 Ω resistor
